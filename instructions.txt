Install the golang.org/x/sys package if you haven't already:
bash
Copy code
go get -u golang.org/x/sys
Compile the program into an executable binary:
bash
Copy code
go build -o time_writer.exe time_writer.go
Open an administrative Command Prompt or PowerShell and navigate to the folder containing the time_writer.exe file.

Create the service:

bash
Copy code
sc create MyTimeWriterSvc binPath= "C:\path\to\time_writer.exe"
Replace C:\path\to\time_writer.exe with the actual path to your compiled binary. This command creates a new Windows service named "MyTimeWriterSvc" and sets the path to the executable.

Set the service to automatically restart:
bash
Copy code
sc failure MyTimeWriterSvc reset= 60 actions= restart/5000/restart/5000/restart/5000
This command sets the service to restart itself after 5 seconds (5000 milliseconds) upon failure, with a reset period of 60 seconds.

Start the service:
bash
Copy code
sc start MyTimeWriterSvc
